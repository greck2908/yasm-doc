 <para>This document describes the internals of the yasm assembler.
  It is written by and for the developers of yasm, not for the users.
  It is not necessary to read or understand any part of this document
  unless you are working with yasm's source code or are just plain
  curious how yasm works internally.</para>

 <para>Note that this design document may not always be in sync with
  the source code, although we try to do our best to update this
  document when changes are made to the source.  If you notice any
  discrepencies, please feel free to fix them (or at least notify the
  development group about it).</para>
