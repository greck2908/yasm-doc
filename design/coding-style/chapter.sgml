  <title>Portability</title>

  <para>For maximum portability, all code should conform to ANSI/ISO
   C89 (C99 is not yet well-supported enough to be portable).
   Prototypes should always be provided for all functions (we don't
   attempt to be friendly to pre-ANSI C compilers; there are just too
   many unknowns).</para>

  <para>Adding small platform-specific features (such as using
   <function>abort</function> instead of <function>exit</function> on
   fatal errors) is allowed, but the functionality should be checked
   for using <application>autoconf</application>.  Major
   platform-specific features should be avoided unless the
   functionality can be emulated on all platforms.  Path and directory
   searches for header files fall into this latter category.</para>

  <para>Functions which are standard in some environments but not
   strictly ANSI C (such as <function>strdup</function> and
   <function>strcasecmp</function>) should be checked for using
   <application>autoconf</application> and functionally identical
   replacements included in the package.</para>

  <para>A small set of allocation replacements are provided that do
   internal allocation failure (NULL return) checks.  These are named
   identically to the functions they replace, with a prepended
   <quote>x</quote>.  E.g. <function>xstrdup</function>,
   <function>xmalloc</function>, etc.  These functions should be used
   instead of the corresponding standard C library functions in order
   to maintain standardized error checking and messages for all memory
   allocation.</para>

 <sect1 id="coding-style.formatting">
  <title>Formatting and Indentation</title>

  <para>An identation level of 4 spaces and 8 spaces to a tab should
   be maintained.  However, at the present time no other specific
   style rules are required.  While any formatting style can be used,
   it is highly recommended that new code match existing code,
   especially when modifying existing files.  There is an
   <filename>.indent.pro</filename> file in the <filename
    class="directory">src/</filename> directory that specifies the
   <quote>standard</quote> (existing) style in the configuration
   format used by GNU <application>indent</application>.  Note that
   this file contains a list of all the typedefs declared in the
   source.  Please keep this list current with the code.</para>
