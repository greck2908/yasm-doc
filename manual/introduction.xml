 <title>Introduction</title>

 <para>Yasm is a (mostly) BSD-licensed assembler that is designed from
  the ground up to allow for multiple assembler syntaxes to be
  supported (e.g. NASM, GNU AS, etc.) in addition to multiple output
  object formats and multiple instruction sets.  Its modular
  architecture allows additional object formats, debug formats, and
  syntaxes to be added relatively easily.</para>

 <para>Yasm started life in 2001 as a rewrite of the NASM (Netwide)
  x86 assembler under the BSD license.  Since then, it has matched and
  exceeded NASM's capabilities, incorporating features such as
  supporting the 64-bit AMD64 architecture, parsing GNU AS syntax, and
  generating STABS, DWARF2, and CodeView 8 debugging
  information.</para>

  <title>License</title>

  <para>Yasm is primarily licensed under the 2-clause and 3-clause
   <quote>revised</quote> BSD licenses, with two exceptions.  The NASM
   preprocessor is imported from the NASM project and is thus LGPL
   licensed.  The Bit::Vector module used by Yasm to implement Yasm's
   large integer and machine-independent floating point support is
   triple-licensed under the Artistic license, GPL, and LGPL.  The
   full text of the licenses are provided in the Yasm source
   distribution.</para>

  <para>This user manual is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license,
   with the exception of <xref linkend="nasm-language" />, <xref
    linkend="nasm-preprocessor" />, and <xref
    linkend="nasm-directives" />, large portions of which are
   copyrighted by the NASM Development Team and licensed under the

  <title>Material Covered in this Book</title>

  <para>This book is intended to be a user's manual for Yasm, serving
   as both an introduction and a general-purpose reference.  While
   mentions may be made in various sections of Yasm's implementation
   (usually to explain the reasons behind bugs or unusual aspects to
   various features), this book will not go into depth explaining how
   Yasm does its job; for an in-depth discussion of Yasm's internals,
   see <citetitle pubwork="book">The Design and Implementation of the
    Yasm Assembler</citetitle>.</para>
