=== Introduction

Yasm is a (mostly) BSD-licensed assembler that is designed from the
ground up to allow for multiple assembler syntaxes to be supported
(e.g. NASM, GNU AS, etc.) in addition to multiple output object
formats and multiple instruction sets.  Its modular architecture
allows additional object formats, debug formats, and syntaxes to be
added relatively easily.

Yasm started life in 2001 as a rewrite of the NASM (Netwide) x86
assembler under the BSD license.  Since then, it has matched and
exceeded NASM's capabilities, incorporating features such as
supporting the 64-bit AMD64 architecture, parsing GNU AS syntax, and
generating STABS, DWARF2, and CodeView 8 debugging information.

=== License

Yasm is primarily licensed under the 2-clause and 3-clause ""revised""
BSD licenses, with two exceptions.  The NASM preprocessor is imported
from the NASM project and is thus LGPL licensed.  The Bit::Vector
module used by Yasm to implement Yasm's large integer and
machine-independent floating point support is triple-licensed under
the Artistic license, GPL, and LGPL.  The full text of the licenses
are provided in the Yasm source distribution.

This user manual is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license, with the
exception of <<nasm-language>>, <<nasm-preprocessor>>, and
<<nasm-directives>>, large portions of which are copyrighted by the
NASM Development Team and licensed under the LGPL.

=== Material Covered in this Book

This book is intended to be a user's manual for Yasm, serving as both
an introduction and a general-purpose reference.  While mentions may
be made in various sections of Yasm's implementation (usually to
explain the reasons behind bugs or unusual aspects to various
features), this book will not go into depth explaining how Yasm does
its job; for an in-depth discussion of Yasm's internals, see _The
Design and Implementation of the Yasm Assembler_.
