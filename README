The following tools are necessary for building most output formats of
the design document (and other DocBook documentation) from their XML
and asciidoc sources:

- GNU make
- asciidoc 8.4.5 + local patch
  The distribution needs to be patched with
  share/asciidoc/asciidoc.py.patch to build correct output.
- dblatex
  dblatex has a number of dependences:
  - Python >= 2.4
  - Recent LaTeX distribution
  - xsltproc
  - XML DocBook 4.1 DTD
- Ghostscript
- groff + GNU pic
- HTML Tidy
- realpath
