The following tools are necessary for building most output formats of the
design document (and other DocBook documentation) from their SGML sources:
- BSD make (not the 'pmake' package, but the 'bmake' package, based on NetBSD's
  make implementation).
- HTML Tidy
- Modular DocBook Stylesheets (DSSSL)
- DocBook 4.1 DTD
- XHTML DTD
- OpenJade (recommended) or Jade
- JadeTeX
- Ghostscript
- Dia

For those fortunate enough (IMHO) to be using FreeBSD, just install the docproj
port or package as well as the Dia port/package to get all the tools necessary
for building ALL output formats.
